# Python Coding Standards
## Coding Best Practices, Standardization, and Documentation Guides

This course is for programmers who want to use Python coding standards to make their applications more readable, maintainable, and sharable. We use the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP8) document to provide guidelines and best practices on how to write Python code. PEP8 addresses topics such as name conventions, code layout, indentation, comments, etc. At the end of the session, we will apply (using a Python GUI editor) the standards to a simple application.

### Installing the Anaconda Python Distribution
