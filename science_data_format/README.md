# Scientific Data Format Files

Many scientific applications require the use of scientific format data files (containing metadata and multi-dimensional arrays) such as netCDF and HDF5. This course will train participants how to manipulate such data format files. We will learn how to use the Python tools NetCDF4 and h5py to read and create files. We will also present examples on how to read data, do calculations and plot data.

**Prerequisites**: Numpy and knowledge of the NetCDF and HDF5 file formats.
